Version 7.3 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

This version is primarily a maintenance release. It makes a significant part
of the handling of linear algebra objects across the various supported
libraries (native, via PETSc and via Trilinos) more consistent in their
interfaces. In addition, it also contains a new tutorial program demonstrating
various ways of generating meshes, introduces better iterators into sparsity
patterns and sparse matrices, and has better ways to deal with multicomponent
problems. Release 7.3 is backward compatible to 7.2.  However, it deprecates a
number of classes and functions that will be removed in the next release.

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Extensive documentation and 46 working example programs
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Locally refined adaptive meshes
- Multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
  scaling from laptops to clusters with 10,000s of processor cores
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
