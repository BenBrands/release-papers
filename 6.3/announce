Version 6.3 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library
awarded the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has
been released. It is available for free under an OpenSource license
from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

Major new features of version 6.3 are:
- Extension of the existing multigrid infrastructure to adaptively
  refined meshes with continuous elements
- The incorporation of the Intel Threading Building Blocks for scalable,
  task-based parallelism on multicore machines throughout the library
- A whole new framework with generic loops, simplifying integrals over meshes
- 4 new extensively documented tutorial programs demonstrating multigrid on
  adaptive meshes, projection solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations,
  eigenvalue problems, and matrix free methods
- Some 100 new functions, classes, and bug fixes.

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Multigrid support
- Locally refined grids
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP) and distributed
  computing
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
