Version 8.2 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

This version has a significant number of noteworthy new features:
- Comprehensive support for geometries described by arbitrary manifolds
  and meshes that respect this description not only on the boundary but
  also internally
- Support for geometries imported from CAD using the OpenCASCADE library
- Three new tutorial programs on complex geometries, CAD geometries, and
  time stepping methods
- Support for users wanting to use C++11 features
- Improvements to multithreading support
- Vectorization of many vector operations using OpenMP SIMD directives
- At least 140 features and bugfixes
