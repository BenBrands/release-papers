Version 7.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an OpenSource license from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

Version 7.0 is a major step forward. Its new features include:
- Support for massively parallel computations that has been shown to scale to
  at least 16,384 processors and a new tutorial program that shows its
  use. The user code for a massively parallel, fully adaptive Laplace solver
  is only some 20 lines of code longer than its sequential version.
- While 2d and 3d programs could always use almost exactly the same code,
  dimension independent programming has become simpler by making sure that 1d
  now works in exactly the same way.
- A new tutorial program on the discretization of PDE on manifolds.
- Nedelec elements are now available to arbitrary order.
- deal.II is now linked into a single library.
- A graphical user interface for input parameter files.

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Locally refined adaptive meshes
- Multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
