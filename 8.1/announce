Version 8.1 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

This version is primarily a maintenance release but still has a number of
noteworthy new features:
- Three new tutorial programs on elasto-plastic contact problems (step-42),
  hybridizable dicontinuous Galerkin methods (step-51), and a simple example
  of using adaptive mesh refinement for time dependent problems (step-26)
- Significantly better support for shared memory multicore parallelism
- Dozens of new features and bugfixes
