Version 6.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library
recently awarded the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has
been released. It is available from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

Major new features of version 6.0 are
- support for hp-finite elements, continuous and discontinuous
- handling of arbitrary hexahedral meshes in 3D
- support for a wider variety of systems, including Mac OS X
- 6 new extensive tutorial programs showing advanced FEM techniques
- some 180 new functions, classes, and bug fixes.

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Multigrid support
- Locally refined grids
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP) and distributed
  computing
- Interfaces to PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms.

deal.II can be downloaded for free and is distributed under an Open
Source license.
