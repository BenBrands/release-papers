Version 8.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

This is a major new release. In particular, it features the following changes:
- The configuration and build system has been switched to cmake, providing
  better support for a wide variety of platforms including Microsoft Windows,
  better integration with IDEs such as Eclipse, and many other advantages.
- deal.II now supports 64bit indices for problems with more than 2
  billion unknowns and has been tested on problems of up to 27 billion
  unknowns.
- deal.II is now licensed under the LGPL.

Further changes include:
- Improvements to parallel linear algebra
- Improvements to multithreading
- Hundreds of new features and bugfixes

The main features of deal.II are:
- Extensive documentation and 46 working example programs
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Locally refined adaptive meshes
- Multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
  scaling from laptops to clusters with 10,000s of processor cores
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
