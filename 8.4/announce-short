Version 8.4.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
- Parallel triangulations can now be partitioned with cell weights.
- Improved support for complex numbers throughout the library.
- A new triangulation type that supports parallel computations but ensures
  that the entire mesh is available on every processor.
- New Rannacher-Turek and Q(p) bubble enriched finite elements
- Initial support for compiling with Visual C++ under Windows.
- see the preprint at https://www.dealii.org/deal84-preprint.pdf
- More than 140 other features and bugfixes, see the full list of changes at  
  https://www.dealii.org/8.4.0/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_8_3_and_8_4.html

The main features of deal.II are:
- Extensive documentation and 52 working example programs
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
  scaling from laptops to clusters with 10,000s of processor cores
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
