Version 6.2 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library
recently awarded the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has
been released. It is available for free under an OpenSource license
from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

Major new features of version 6.2 are:
- The ability to do anisotropic mesh refinement in both 2d and 3d
- Support for meshes defined on curved manifolds, and the discretization
  of partial differential or boundary integral equations on such domains
- 4 new extensively documented tutorial programs demonstrating solving
  boundary integral equations, the Boussinesq equations, anisotropic
  mesh refinement, and an application from nuclear reactor engineering
- Interfaces to the linear algebra classes in the Trilinos library
- Support for vastly faster matrix assembly on structured meshes
- Some 120 new functions, classes, and bug fixes.

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Multigrid support
- Locally refined grids
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP) and distributed
  computing
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
