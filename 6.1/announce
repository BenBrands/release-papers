Version 6.1 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library
recently awarded the J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has
been released. It is available from the deal.II home-page at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

Major new features of version 6.1 are:
- 3 new extensive tutorial programs showing advanced FEM techniques for
  complex-valued problems, the Stokes equations, and the Euler equations of
  compressible gas dynamics
- Improved hp finite element support
- A simpler and more powerful method to assemble matrices and vectors for
  systems of partial differential equations
- A method to postprocess numerical solutions and write derived quantities
  into output files for graphical visualization 
- A much improved sparse ILU
- Some 60 new functions, classes, and bug fixes.

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and working example programs
- Multigrid support
- Locally refined grids
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for symmetric multi-processing (SMP) and distributed
  computing
- Interfaces to PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a variety of visualization platforms.

deal.II can be downloaded for free and is distributed under an Open
Source license.
