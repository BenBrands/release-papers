  This paper provides an overview of the new features of the finite element
  library \dealii{} version 8.5.
\end{abstract}


\section{Overview}

\dealii{} version 8.5.0 was released March 11, 2017. This paper provides an
overview of the new features of this release and serves as a citable
reference for the \dealii{} software library version 8.5. \dealii{} is an
object-oriented finite element library used around the world in the
development of finite element solvers. It is available for free under the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) from the \dealii{} homepage at
\url{http://www.dealii.org/}.

The major changes of this release are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\item More than 140 other features and bugfixes.
\end{itemize}
The more important ones of these will be detailed in the following section.
Information on how to cite \dealii{} is provided in Section \ref{sec:cite}.


\section{Significant changes to the library}

This release of \dealii{} contains a number of large and significant changes
that will be discussed in the following sections. It of course also contains a
vast number of smaller changes and added functionality; the details of these
can be found
\href{https://www.dealii.org/8.4.0/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_8_3_and_8_4.html}{in the file that lists all changes for this release} (see \cite{changes84})
and that is linked to from the web site of each release as well as the
release announcement.

\subsubsection{Other incompatible changes}

The
\href{https://www.dealii.org/8.4.0/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_8_3_and_8_4.html}{file
  that lists all changes for this release} (see \cite{changes84}) lists another 18
incompatible changes, but none of these should in fact be visible in
typical user codes. Some remove previously deprecated classes and
functions, and the majority change internal interfaces that are not
typically used in user codes.



\section{How to cite \dealii{}}\label{sec:cite}

In order to justify the work the developers of \dealii{} put into this
software, we ask that papers using the library reference one of the
\dealii{} papers. This helps us justify the effort we put into it.

There are various ways to reference \dealii{}. To acknowledge the use of a
particular version of the library, reference the present document. For up
to date information and bibtex snippets for this document see:

The original \texttt{\dealii{}} paper containing an overview of its
architecture is \cite{BangerthHartmannKanschat2007}. If you rely on specific
features of the library, please consider citing any of the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item For geometric multigrid: \cite{Kanschat2004,JanssenKanschat2011};
 \item For distributed parallel computing: \cite{BangerthBursteddeHeisterKronbichler11};
 \item For $hp$ adaptivity: \cite{BangerthKayserHerold2007};
 \item For matrix-free and fast assembly techniques:
   \cite{KronbichlerKormann2012};
 \item For computations on lower-dimensional manifolds:
   \cite{DeSimoneHeltaiManigrasso2009};
 \item For integration with CAD files and tools:

 \item For \texttt{LinearOperator} and \texttt{PackagedOperation} facilities:
   \cite{MaierBardelloniHeltai-2016-a,MaierBardelloniHeltai-2016-b}.
 \item For uses of the \texttt{WorkStream} interface:
   \cite{TKB16}.
\end{itemize}

\dealii{} can interface with many other libraries:
\begin{itemize}
\item ARPACK \cite{arpack}
\item BLAS, LAPACK
\item HDF5 \cite{hdf5}
\item METIS \cite{karypis1998fast}

\item Threading Building Blocks \cite{Rei07}
\item Trilinos \cite{trilinos,trilinos-web-page}
\item UMFPACK \cite{umfpack}
\end{itemize}
Please consider citing the appropriate references if you use interfaces to these
libraries.
