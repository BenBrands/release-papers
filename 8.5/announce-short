Version 8.5.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:

- The CellDataStorage class provides a mechanism to store and communicate
  user-defined data on each cell.
- The MappingManifold class provides exact mapping between the reference cell
  and a mesh cell.
- Various improvements for high-order elements.
- The LinearOperator class has been extended by a generic ``payload''
  mechanism that allows the attachment of arbitrary additional information.
- A dedicated physics module to provide definitions and operations
  used in continuum mechanics.
- The FE_Enriched class implements the operation of enriching the finite
  element space of an underlying element.
- The FESeries namespace provides expansions of a finite element solution in
  terms of different, hierarchical bases.
- New tutorial programs step-55, step-56, and step-57; as well as updates to
  step-27, step-37, and step-44. In addition, the separate code gallery of
  deal.II has gained a number of new entries.
- More than 240 other features and bugfixes, see the full list of changes at
  https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/changes_between_8_4_2_and_8_5_0.html

The main features of deal.II are:
- Extensive documentation and 55 working example programs
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
  scaling from laptops to clusters with 10,000s of processor cores
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
