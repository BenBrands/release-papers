Version 8.5.0 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:

- The CellDataStorage class provides a mechanism to store and communicate
  user-defined data on each cell.
- The MappingManifold class provides mappings between the reference cell and a
  mesh cell that is exact, rather than the usual polynomial approximations of
  a manifold.
- Various improvements for high-order elements, including a switch of support
  points in FE_Q and FE_DGQ to Gauss-Lobatto support points, stable
  evaluation of high-order Legendre polynomials, and several bugfixes for
  high-order polynomial mappings defined through the MappingQ class.
- The LinearOperator class has been extended by a generic ``payload''
  mechanism that allows the attachment of arbitrary additional information to
  a LinearOperator.
- A dedicated physics module to provide definitions and operations
  used in continuum mechanics.
- The FE_Enriched class implements the operation of enriching the finite
  element space of an underlying element.
- The FESeries namespace provides expansions of a finite element solution in
  terms of different, hierarchical bases.
- New tutorial programs step-55, step-56, and step-57; as well as updates to
  step-27, step-37, and step-44. In addition, the separate code gallery of
  deal.II has gained a number of new entries.
- Static code analyzers are valuable tools to improve and maintain the quality
  of the code in our library in addition to build and regression tests for a
  variety of setups. This release was tested with Cppcheck, PVS-Studio, and
  Coverity-Scan.
- More than 240 other features and bugfixes.
