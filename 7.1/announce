Version 7.1 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   http://www.dealii.org/

This version has a large number of enhancements:
- A tutorial program (step-32) demonstrating the solution of the Boussinesq
  equation on hundreds or thousands of processors
- A tutorial program (step-46) solving a fluid-structure interaction problem
  and showing how to implement problems in which different equations hold in
  different parts of the domain
- Improved support for massively large computations and for multiphysics
  problems throughout the library
- Support for serialization of most classes to allow checkpoint/restart
- More robust interfaces to Trilinos and PETSc
- More than 100 other changes and bug fixes throughout the library.

All main features of the previous versions have been continued and improved:
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Extensive documentation and 40 working example programs
- Locally refined adaptive meshes
- Multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
  scaling from laptops to clusters with 10,000s of processor cores
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
