Version 8.3 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

The major changes of this release are:
- Improved handling of parallel distributed meshes, including a better
  numbering of cells on coarse meshes based on a hierarchical concept instead
  of Cuthill-McKee numbering.
- New abstract C++11 interface to linear operators.
- All examples have been changed to use the new DynamicSparsityPattern.
- Improved support for periodic boundary conditions with arbitrary
  orientations.
- New quadrature formulas.
- Full conversion to the new manifold mechanism (manifold_id) for boundary
  descriptions.
- Better support for complex-valued problems by doing internal arithmetic in
  the correct data types, rather than defaulting to double precision.
- An implementation of Bernstein polynomial-based finite elements.
- Interface to the new algebraic multilevel package MueLu of the Trilinos
  project.
- More descriptive exception messages in many places for improved user
  productivity in code development.
- More than 140 other features and bugfixes.

The main features of deal.II are:
- Extensive documentation and 52 working example programs
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Locally refined adaptive meshes
- Multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Fast linear algebra
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
  scaling from laptops to clusters with 10,000s of processor cores
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
