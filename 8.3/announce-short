Version 8.3 of deal.II, the object-oriented finite element library awarded the
J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, has been released. It is
available for free under an Open Source license from the deal.II homepage at

                   https://www.dealii.org/

Among the major changes of this release are:
- Improved handling of parallel distributed meshes.
- New abstract C++11 interface to linear operators.
- Conversion of tutorials to the new manifold mechanism for boundary descriptions. 
- Better support for complex-valued problems.
- More descriptive exception messages in many places.
- More than 140 other features and bugfixes.

The main features of deal.II are:
- Extensive documentation and 52 working example programs
- Support for dimension-independent programming
- Locally refined adaptive meshes and multigrid support
- A zoo of different finite elements
- Built-in support for shared memory and distributed parallel computing,
  scaling from laptops to clusters with 10,000s of processor cores
- Interfaces to Trilinos, PETSc, METIS, UMFPACK and other external software
- Output for a wide variety of visualization platforms.
